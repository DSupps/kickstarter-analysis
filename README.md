# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
**Performing analysis on past Kickstarter funding campaigns to uncover trends**

*The purpose of this is to help Louise, an up and coming playwrite, to start a funding campaign for her play Fever*.

**Goal statement**

The goal is provide Louise some guidance with her decision to start a Kickstarter funding campaign. 

To do this, I will look at data from past successful and unsuccessful Kickstarter fund raising campaigns in the US. By looking at both successful vs unsuccessful campaigns, we can get an idea for what did and didn't work.  We can then determine the best course of action at launch. 

**Findings**

- Theater/plays have been popular and successful type of campaign overall. 

- Launching a campaign in May, June, and July would be best. 

- The $10,000 proposed budget (more than double the average successful campaign) puts her at a higher risk of failing. 


**Visualizations**

We can see that theater follows the overall trend: there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in May, but that tapers off by the end of the year.


**Future Projects**
Louise mentioned earlier that she's also interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals
